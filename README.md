How to scrap whatsapp group contacts from https://web.whatsapp.com/
This will enable you to get group contacts from your whatsapp specific group you chose as a list on csv or excel

### 👯Clone Project
```shell
git clone https://github.com/itzshoaibmalik/Whatsapp-Group-Scrapper
```
### 🍴Fork Project
You can fork this project by clicking `fork button` 👉

## 🚀How to use it?
1. Open your `"Whatsapp Web"` from a browser: "https://web.whatsapp.com/"
2. Select a `Whatsapp Group`
3. Press `F12` or `Ctrl-Shift-I`(Windows) / `Cmd-Shift-I`(Mac) to open the browser console
4. Paste this whole code and press `ENTER` key
5. It will ask you to where to save your `.csv` file (It will already automatically input your Group Name as file name)

Now you can open your file and find your list of contacts which specifies the following:
The header will tell you the group name and number of contacts that it has in that group
Column A - num : will tell you the phone number of your contacts if not already registered in your phone's contact
Column B = name: will tell you the unlisted number's owner (name), and it will show NO_NAME if it's already listed in your contacts
Column C = img: will give you the link for the contact's profile picture for you to download manually
Column D = status: will give you the current status as of now from the particular contact

If this project has helped you please give me a "STAR" up above and help spread the news.

Thanks.
